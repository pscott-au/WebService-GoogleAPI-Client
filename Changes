ENHANCEMENTS
- add support for service accounts
- rework storage backend to allow custom implementations (here's looking at you, redis)
- allow introspection for credentials on $res returned from an api query

BREAKING CHANGES
- will immediately on non-existent API endpoints
- rework AuthStorage classes: anything that depended on
  ::AuthStorage or ::Credentials in an undocumented way will likely explode.
  Please open an issue on github and I'll try and help you migrate
- remove some undocumented options
- the examples/ dir MAY be broken, I didn't check (they need cleaning up anyways)
