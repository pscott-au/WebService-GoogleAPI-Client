we're trying to take care of a bunch of things.

In order to implement service accounts, we need to have an
encapsulated interface for retrieving and refreshing tokens. Then,
there can be a shared interface, and both normal files and service
accounts can be called the same way.

We expect to implement something which parses the json file, and
then determines what type it is. A gapi file has 'gapi' as the top
level key. A service account has the following top level keys:
qw/ type project_id private_key_id private_key client_email
client_id auth_uri token_uri auth_provider_x509_cert_url
client_x509_cert_url /.



#Other Issues

We'd like to implement a cache for constructing calls, b/c it
works WAAAY too hard. Constructing 100 calls to
sheets.spreadsheets.values.batchGetByDataFilter made my CPU churn
like a tell, and for way too long, too.


I'd like to abstract the interpolation and crud into a seperate
module, so that I could use it to make the inner requests for a
batch request.

I'd like to implement generators for the main ua, and use that as
an interface for adding the headers and crud. The only reason to
not use the 'start' hook is b/c we don't want our auth stuff on a
request for a token. Unless it doesn't matter...

We need some live tests that we'll put in the xt directory, so
that we can be sure that when it's live things work.

We must fix all the weird warnings in the test suite, and improve
our coverage and stuff.
